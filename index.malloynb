Search indexes are generally used by Malloy Composer (Malloy's BI interface), but can also be used for other things.\n\nWhen filtering data, you might know a term, but not necessarily which column in the one of the join data contains it.  Indexing the data on field names and high cardinality fields let's you qucikly find the term and the associated value.\n\nThough I haven't played with it.  Indexing could be used by LLMs to find the interesting column/term mapping in the data set.\n\n## Simple Example\nWe're going to take the airports table and index it.  Some things to notice.\n\n* The query operator `index:` takes a list of dimensions we would like in our index.  \n* The results of an index are unordered, so we pass the result to another stage to order the results.  \n* In this case, `weight` is the row count of the results returned.  \n* non-string -type fields are represented as ranges across all rows.\n* Click `ShowSQL` to see how this query works in SQL.",
