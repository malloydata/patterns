[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"# Malloy Quickstart\n\nThis guide introduces the basics of querying and modeling with Malloy.  You can run and or modify all queries in this notbeook.  Everything is running in your browser.\n\n\n\n## Leading with the Source\n\nQueries are of the form: _source_ `->` _operation_\n\nIn Malloy, the source of a query is either a raw table, a [modeled source](source.md), or another query.\n\nIn this example, the `table()` function provides the query _source_ from a table (or view) in the database.\nThe query _operation_ is explicit about which fields are grouped, aggregated or projected.\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"malloy","value":"query: table('duckdb:data/airports.parquet') -> {\n  group_by: state\n  aggregate: airport_count is count()\n  limit: 10\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\n## Query Operators\n\nIn SQL, the <code>SELECT</code> command does two very different things.  A <code>SELECT</code> with a <code>GROUP BY</code> aggregates data according to the <code>GROUP BY</code> clause and produces aggregate calculation against every calculation not in the <code>GROUP BY</code>.  In Malloy, the query operator for this is `group_by:`.  Calculation about data in the group are made using `aggregate:`.\n\nThe second type of <code>SELECT</code> in SQL does not perform any aggregation;  All rows in the input table, unless filtered in some way, show up in the output table. In Malloy, this command is called `project:`.\n\nIn the query below, the data will be grouped by `state` and will produce an aggregate calculation for `airport_count` and `average_elevation`.  `group_by:`. The `aggregate:` list can contain references to existing aggregate fields or add new aggregate computations.\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"malloy","value":"query: table('duckdb:data/airports.parquet') -> {\n  group_by:\n    state\n    county\n  aggregate:\n    airport_count is count()\n    average_elevation is avg(elevation)\n  limit: 10\n}\n"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\n### Multiple Field Operations\n\nMultiple `group_by:` and `aggregate:` statements can appear in the same query operation.

In the example below, we create a *source* object named `airports` and add a `dimension:` calculation for `county_and_state` and `measure:` calculation for `airport_count`.  Dimensions can be used in `group_by:`, `project:` and `where:`.

Malloy's filtering is more powerful and expressive than that of SQL. When querying data, we first isolate the data we are interested in (filter it) and then perform aggregations and calculations on the data we've isolated (shape it). Malloy provides consistent syntax for filtering everywhere within a query.\n\n### Filtering the Source\n\nA filter on a data source table narrows down which data is included to be passed to the query _operation_. This translates\nto a <code>WHERE</code> clause in SQL.\nIn this case, the data from the table is filtered to just airports in California.\n\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"malloy","value":"query: table('duckdb:data/airports.parquet') { where: state = 'CA' } -> {\n  top: 2\n  group_by: county\n  aggregate: airport_count is count()\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\n### Filtering Query Stages\n\nFilters can also be applied to any query _operation_.

This section gives a brief introduction to some of these tools, but for more details see the [Time Ranges](time-ranges.md) section.\n\n### Time Literals\n\nLiterals of type `date` and `timestamp` are notated with an `@`, e.g. `@2003-03-29` or `@1994-07-14 10:23:59`. Similarly, years (`@2021`), quarters (`@2020-Q1`), months (`@2019-03`), weeks (`@WK2021-08-01`), and minutes (`@2017-01-01 10:53`) can be expressed.\n\nTime literals can be used as values, but are more often useful in filters.

These are represented like `@2003 to @2005` and `@2004-Q1 for 6 quarters` respectively. These ranges can be used in filters just like time literals.\n\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"malloy","value":"query: table('duckdb:data/flights.parquet') { where: dep_time ? @2003 to @2005 } -> {\n  aggregate: flight_count is count()\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\nTime literals and truncations can also behave like time ranges.

Similarly, when a time value is truncated, it takes on the\ntimeframe from the truncation, e.g. `now.month` means the entirety of the current month.\n\nWhen a time range is used in a comparison, `=` checks for \"is in the range\", `>` \"is after\", and `<` \"is before.\" So `some_time > @2003` filters dates starting on January 1, 2004, while `some_time = @2003` filters to dates in the year 2003.\n\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"malloy","value":"query: table('duckdb:data/flights.parquet') { where: dep_time > @2003 } -> {\n  top: 3; order_by: departure_date asc\n  group_by: departure_date is dep_time.day\n  aggregate: flight_count is count()\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\n## Nested Queries\n\nThe next several examples will use this simple source definition (defined above)\n"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"```malloy\nsource: airports is table('duckdb:data/airports.parquet') {\n  dimension: county_and_state is concat(county, ', ', state)\n  measure: airport_count is count()\n  measure: average_elevation is avg(elevation)\n}\n```"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"\n### Aggregating Subqueries\n\nIn Malloy, queries can be [nested](nesting.md) to produce subtables on each output row.
